# Overview

The scripts in this directory were used to check the status of collection on the antlets.

`audio_count_on.py` is run on the client antlet while the data collection process is taking place.
It returns statistics of how many audio files have been captured recently,
in order to see that operation is happening as normal.
Results are printed to the console.

`audio_count.py` and `img_count.py` count numbers of files after collection has ended.
Results are printed to files.
